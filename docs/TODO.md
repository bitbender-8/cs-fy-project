# Cleanup tasks

- [ ] (bitbender-8): Add a route to serve files. Make sure to create openapi docs for it.
- [ ] (bitbender-8): The when document urls are stored, they probably need to have the domain appended to them so that they can be served properly.
- DOC-UPDATE: Update diagrams marked with `[update at end]` at the testing phase.

## Things to discuss

- Auth0 offers phone based passwordless auth0, it does not let you use phone numbers as a substitute for emails. we may not want this approch so, because of billing costs and other reasons.
