- Consider overhauling the way you handle documents. Each document should have a name or an id or some descriptive fields. Especially the relationships between redacted and unredacted documents must be ironed out.

- Auth0 offers phone based passwordless auth0, it does not let you use phone numbers as a substitute for emails. we may not want this approch so, because of billing costs and other reasons.
